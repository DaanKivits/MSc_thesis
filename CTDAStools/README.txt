The 'CTDAS_tools' folder contains additional scripts that can be used for various operations when running simulations using 
the CTDAS shell.

Here is a short explanation of the functionality of the scripts included in this directory:

- calc_wavenum.py: can help with setting up spectral nudging capabilities within WRF(-CHEM) simulations
- ctdas_lib.r: contains CTDAS-related libraries that can be used when scripting in R.
- project_parameterfile.r: contains CTDAS-related libraries that can be used in transforming a project parameter file from the CTDAS 
    gridded statevector to the WRF(-CHEM) domain.
