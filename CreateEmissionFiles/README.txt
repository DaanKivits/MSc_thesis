# Daan Kivits, 2023

The 'CreateEmissionFiles' directory contains multiple sub-directories in which we have put scripts that we used to create the
CTE-HR input emission files that were needed in our FLEXPART and WRF-CHEM experiments (concentration space).

Here we will shortly discuss the contents of each of the directories:

- FLEXPART: contains scripts we used to create FLEXPART-compatible CTE-HR input emission files, 
    also for the PFT-based experiments.
- WRF-CHEM: contains scripts we used to create WRF-CHEM-compatible CTE-HR input emission files.
