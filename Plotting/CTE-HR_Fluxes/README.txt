The 'CTE-HR_Fluxes' folder contains Python-based scripts that were used in to check both the emission flux files provided by Friedemann Reum
(personal communications, 2022) and the CTE-HR fluxes. 

Here is a short explanation of the functionality of the scripts included in this directory:

- Plot_CTEHR_JAS.py: Plots the average CTE-HR flux anomalies for July, August, and September (JAS) of different 
    climate reference periods compared to 2018.
- Plot_CTEHR_monthly_horizontal.py: Plots the average monthly CTE-HR flux anomalies horizontally (2 rows, 3 columns) for the growing season of different 
    climate reference periods compared to 2018.
- Plot_CTEHR_monthly_upright.py: Plots the average monthly CTE-HR flux anomalies vertically (3 rows, 2 columns) for the growing season of different 
    climate reference periods compared to 2018.
- Plot_CTEHR_yearmean.py: Plots the average CTE-HR biospheric CO2 flux field for 2018.
- Plot_CTEHR_PFTmap.py: Plots the CORINE-based SiB4 PFT landuse type map over Europe.
